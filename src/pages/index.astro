                No subscriptions - just pay per event! Prices typically range
                from $20-40, with some free events too. Your ticket includes the
                activity and often extras like drinks or snacks, depending on
                the venue.

                Not at all! Most of our attendees come solo - it's the best way
                to meet new people. Our hosts and activity-based format make it
                natural and comfortable to connect with other singles. You'll
                find plenty of other solo attendees looking for meaningful
                connections.
